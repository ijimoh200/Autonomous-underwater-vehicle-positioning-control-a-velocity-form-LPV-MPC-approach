# Autonomous-underwater-vehicle-positioning-control-a-velocity-form-LPV-MPC-approach
This repository presents the implementation of the LPV-MPC positioning controller in the conference paper: Jimoh, I.A., Yue, H. and Küçükdemiral, I.B., 2023. Autonomous underwater vehicle positioning control-a velocity form LPV-MPC approach. IFAC-PapersOnLine, 56(2), pp.4388-4393.

The velocity-form LPV-MPC algorithm leverages the interconnection between the kinematic and dynamic models of marine vehicles to mitigate steady-state tracking errors. The controller is implemented in both MATLAB and Python.
